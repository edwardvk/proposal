An Atheist Thrift Shop Proposal
=========================

* This thrift shop is Atheist, so it is not affiliated to any religious organisation or religion in any way. 
* Aim of this document is to define exactly what we're planning to achieve. We hope this might make it suitable for crowd funding.

What's it called
----------------
* Opporunity Shop
* The International Thrift Store (TITS)
* The Atheist Opporunity Shopping Network

Aim
---

* To create jobs
* To recycle goods

How it works
------------

* We accept donations of goods such as clothing and household items at various drop-off points. 
* We can also come and collect items from you.
* All items are immediately catalogued. They are photographed and loaded onto the system.
* Items then go for sorting. Some items might be discarded for recycling, or passed on to other organisations. This will be documented. Every item can be tracked on our online system.
* Items then go for cleaning. The cleaning department will wash the cloths, or clean the items reasonably.
* Items then go for mending, if necessary. Usually clothing that is donated has some sort of defect. 
* Items then go for price assessment. 
* Price reassessment. If an item is not being sold. The price must be reduced. 
* All items (including previously items) can be searched online. This helps with future price assessment. 
* The shop will be registed as a normal company, not a section 21. The additional onerous nature of section 21 company incurs additional costs to the company. Additionally we don't feel that section 21 companies actually make it more trustworthy. Instead, we will pledge to aim for zero profit and achieve trust by making all out financial information open to the public via the online website. 
* We will try use vacant and unused retail space. Owners might be willing to let us the premises at zero or very low cost if we agree to vacant the premises at a moments notice. 
* The shop is not run by volunteers, it is staffed. And staff members are paid.
